			<h3>50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary </h3>
			<hr>
			<p>On May 6, 1970, Pennsylvania Act 120 was enacted. This legislation established PennDOT, the STC, and the Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC). This extremely important piece of legislation shifted the transportation focus from highways and bridges to the safe movement of people and goods using all forms of transportation. On May 6, 2020 the 50th anniversary of Act 120 was recognized as a significant milestone for PennDOT, the STC, and TAC!</p>

			<h3>COVID-19 Response</h3>
			<hr>
			<img src="img/penndot.jpg" class="bg3-img">
			<p style="margin-bottom: -20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Pennsylvania took quick and decisive action in the spring of 2020 to slow the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and protect all Pennsylvanians. Safe and reliable transportation remained just as important, if not more so, during the crisis. As such, it was extremely important to maintain essential services while enacting procedures to limit the spread of the virus. PennDOT temporarily halted all construction projects until plans for worker safety could be developed and implemented. </p>
			<p>PennDOT also closed Driver License Centers and extended the expiration date for certain driver’s licenses, vehicle registrations, and safety and emissions inspections. Despite having never teleworked, many PennDOT employees quickly shifted to working from home when the offices closed. This included the unprecedented shift of the regional Traffic Management Centers that oversee the daily operations of Pennsylvania’s highways to remote locations.  </p>

		<!-- <h1 class="w3-center w3-text-dark-blue">FUNDING</h1> -->
		<h3 class="w3-center w3-text-blue">TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IN PENNSYLVANIA</h3>
		<p>Transportation projects listed in the TYP use a combination of federal, state, and local funding. The available amounts over the twelve years reflect anticipated financial investments based upon legislation, actual and anticipated budgets, and historical trends.</p>
		
		<p class="w3-center w3-text-blue w3-large">CLICK BELOW FOR DETAILS ON EACH TOPIC</p>
		<button class="w3-block w3-left-align accordion">Federal Funding</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Authorization legislation determines the amount and category of federal money distributed to states. The end of the most recent legislation, Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act on September 30, 2020 causes uncertainty for the amount of expected federal funding for highways, bridges, and public transit throughout the TYP. The potential bankruptcy of the Federal Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy only increase the uncertainty. However, the 2021 TYP assumes federal funding levels will remain flat, at 2020 levels, throughout the twelve years. </p>
				<div class="callout-box" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
					<h5 class="w3-center">Federal Highway Trust Fund</h5>
					<p>The Federal Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is composed of taxes paid at the fuel pump (18.4 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel fuel) and other excise taxes. The money in the HTF is used for roadway, bridge, and public transit projects. For many years, the tax money coming into the fund has been less than what is allowed to be spent. As a result, Congress must occasionally refill the HTF through other sources of money.</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
		<button class="w3-block w3-left-align accordion">State Funding</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>The annual state budget process determines the funding amounts available for projects on the TYP through allocations from several monetary sources:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Motor License Fund – Highway, bridge and safety projects on the TYP; county and municipal road and bridge improvements; and Pennsylvania State Police Operations</li>
					<li>Public Transportation Trust Fund – Mass transit operating expenses and asset improvements</li>
					<li>Multimodal Transportation Fund – Grants for all modes</li>
					<li>Public Transportation Assistance Fund – Mass transit operating expenses and asset management projects</li>
					<li>General Fund – Aviation and rail freight projects</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Overall funding at the state level is also uncertain throughout the TYP due to declining revenue from reduced gas tax receipts, inflationary pressures, and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
			</div>
		<button class="w3-block w3-left-align accordion">Local Funding</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>Local municipalities, private entities, toll authorities, and transit operators also provide funds that are accounted for in the TYP. These funds are most often included when a match is required for state or federal funds.</p>
			</div>
		<button class="w3-block w3-left-align accordion">2021 Funding Levels</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>The 2021 TYP contains over !!!!$TBD!!!! in projects involving all modes of transportation. The table below shows the distribution of funding in millions of dollars for the first four years, the second four years, and the third four years, and the total TYP.</p>

			<p>In 2019 the Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) released its “Risks to Transportation Funding in Pennsylvania” report. The report identified and analyzed several potential threats to the funding that supports the TYP. The impacts and implications identified in the report underscore the uncertainty involved in transportation funding, especially considering the unanticipated revenue pressures experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

			<h3>Transportation Advisory Committee</h3>
			<hr>
			<p style="margin-bottom: -20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">In addition to establishing PennDOT and the STC, Act 120 of 1970 also created the Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC). The 30 member TAC is comprised of 18 members of the public, 4 members of the Pennsylvania Legislature, and leaders from several state agencies. </p>

			<div class="panel">
				<p>The Twelve Year Transportation Program (TYP) is Pennsylvania’s official mid-range planning tool and is required by Act 120 of 1970. The TYP identifies and prioritizes projects and funding over a 12-year period. The first four years is the federally required Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and regional Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs).</p>
				<p>The TYP is updated every two years in a collaborative effort between PennDOT, the STC, regional Metropolitan and Rural Planning Organizations (MPOs and RPOs), and the public. The TYP represents all modes and means of transportation including highways, bridges, public transit, aviation, and rail, as well as active transportation such as bicycling and walking. </p>

		<button class="w3-block w3-left-align accordion">Statewide Long Range Transportation Plan</button>
			<div class="panel">
				<p>The Statewide Long Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) is PennDOT’s largest and most comprehensive statewide transportation plan. It covers a 25-year forecast period. The Statewide LRTP is used to develop transportation policies, visions, and goals for the Commonwealth. The TYP must align with the Statewide LRTP which is updated every five to six years. The 2045 Statewide LRTP and Comprehensive Freight Movement Plan is expected to be adopted in 2021.</p>
			</div>

				<li>Regional and statewide goals and targets for infrastructure performance and condition</li>
				<li>Public input</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Projects are organized by the associated MPO or RPO and further described by transportation mode and county. Transportation project costs are allocated over one or more four-year periods based on the anticipated schedule of the project. The TYP also includes line items by funding category which are typically seen in the second and third four-year program periods. As new projects are identified, the line items are adjusted to reflect the detailed phases and costs associated to advance the project, all within fiscal constraints.</p>
		<h3 class="w3-text-light-blue">Transportation Program Review and Approval</h3>
		<p>PennDOT submits the TYP to the STC every two years. The STC reviews and votes to adopt the TYP. PennDOT then sends the STIP (the first four years of the TYP) to the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for review and approval prior to the start of the federal fiscal year on October 1.</p>

		<p>Public involvement is an important part of the TYP update process. Every two years, the STC holds a Public Comment Period to request feedback on local, regional, and statewide transportation issues and priorities. All responses are compiled, documented, and analyzed for use in the TYP, regional TIPs, and regional LRTPs. Public feedback plays a key role in the decision-making process for identifying and funding transportation projects.</p>

			<h3>Traffic Incident Management</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>PennDOT, Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC), and Penn State University (PSU) began a partnership in 2018 to explore and advance a state-of-the-art training and testing facility called the Pennsylvania Safety Transportation and Research Track (PennSTART). PennSTART will address the transportation safety and operational needs of Pennsylvania: traffic incident management (TIM); tolling and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technology; work zones; commercial vehicles; transit vehicles; and connected and automated vehicles. PennSTART as well as Pennsylvania Traffic Incident Management Enhancement (PennTIME), an organization of stakeholders involved in Transportation Incident Management, evolved from a 2014 <a href="https://talkpatransportation.com/assets/TAC/Traffic Incident Management Final Report Feb. 2014.pdf">Traffic Incident Management study</a> completed by the State Transportation Advisory Committee. </p>

			<h3><a href="https://www.dmv.pa.gov/REALID/Pages/default.aspx">REAL ID</a></h3>
			<hr>
			<p style="margin-bottom: -20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Beginning October 1, 2021, Pennsylvanians will need a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license, photo ID card, or another form of federally-acceptable identification (such as a valid passport or military ID) to board a domestic commercial flight or enter a federal building or military installation that requires ID. PennDOT began issuing REAL IDs on March 1, 2019 and issued over 800,000 within the first year.</p>
			<p>The REAL ID initiative is required by both federal and state legislation. PennDOT worked with Homeland Security, the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, and the Social Security Administration to enhance the integrity and security of state-issued driver licenses and identification cards. Real IDs are intended to aid in fighting terrorism and further reduce the risk for fraud.</p>

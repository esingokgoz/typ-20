00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I am very pleased to present to you, on behalf of the Pennsylvania State Transportation Commission,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, and our many Transportation Partners across the state, 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the 2019 Pennsylvania Twelve Year Transportation Program.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The Twelve Year Transportation Program, or TYP,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
is updated every two years in partnership with our Metropolitan and Rural Planning Organizations

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and many other key stakeholders including you. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This is Pennsylvania's most comprehensive tool to identify and prioritize multimodal projects. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
As such, the 2019 TYP represents PennDOT's continued commitment to enhanced decision-making 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the purposeful planning initiatives launched during the 2017 program development process.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I commend our regional transportation Planning Partners and the State Transportation Commission

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
for their continued dedication to this critical planning process, and extensive public engagement efforts.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And of course, again, my thanks to you, for contributing your time, comments, ideas and projects.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Planning for the many transportation modes associated with Pennsylvaniaâ€™s immense transportation system

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
impacts every resident, business, and visitor of the Commonwealth.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Together, we will continue to find solutions to sustain

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and expand mobility throughout the Commonwealth today, and well into the future.
